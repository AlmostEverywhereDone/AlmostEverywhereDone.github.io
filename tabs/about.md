# ¡Hi!
Welcome to my personal website. I am a graduate in Mathematics from the National University of Engineering (Lima, Perú), and my passion lies in solving problems and sharing the knowledge I've gained throughout my studies. On this site, you will find detailed solutions to a selection of exercises from books on Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Multivariable Analysis, among others.

I plan to update the page regularly, adding new content and improving my web design skills, which are currently quite limited. As I progress with this project, I hope the site will evolve into a more robust and visually appealing resource.

I am aware that I may make mistakes, so if you find any errors or have suggestions to improve the content or functionality of the site, I would be immensely grateful if you let me know. You can contact me via my email: ...

Finally, if you wish to support my work and help me continue developing this project, I have included my PayPal account and the Yape QR code (exclusive to Peru). Any contribution will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you find the content I share here useful.
